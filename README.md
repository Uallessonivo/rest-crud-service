# REST CRUD Service with Spring Boot, Security, JPA, and Hibernate

Welcome to the "rest-crud-service" repository! 
This project has been developed as part of my course on Spring Boot, Security, JPA, and Hibernate. 
Here, you'll find the source code and related resources for building a REST service with CRUD operations using the mentioned technologies.

# Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a practical and educational example of building a robust and secure web service using the Spring ecosystem. It covers everything from basic Spring Boot configuration to implementing authentication and authorization with Spring Security, handling persistent data with JPA and Hibernate, and creating RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.

# Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: A framework that simplifies the creation of Java applications with predefined configurations and modules.
- Spring Security: An extension of Spring that provides authentication and authorization for Java applications.
- JPA (Java Persistence API): A Java standard API that describes the management of the lifecycle of persistent objects in a relational database management system.
- Hibernate: A Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that simplifies the mapping of Java objects to database tables.
